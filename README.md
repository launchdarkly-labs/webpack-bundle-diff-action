# Webpack bundle diff action

This action computes a diff between two webpack stats files, and creates
a comment on the pull request.

## Usage

Add this to a `.yml` file under `.github/workflows/`:

```
TODO
```

## Contributing

```bash
npm install
```

Once you've made the changes you wanted, you can release a new version by following these steps:

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm run package
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Commit message'
```
