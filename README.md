# Webpack bundle diff action ðŸ—œ

This action computes a diff of bundle sizes between a head branch and a base branch, and posts a comment to your pull request with useful information.

## Improvements

This section contains ideas for how to make this better.

## Usage

This workflow assumes there is a script called `yarn webpack:stats` which generates,
- a webpack stats json file (we might not need this anymoreâ€¦)
- a webpack-bundle-analyzer report json file

Add this to a `.yml` file under `.github/workflows/`:

```yaml

  pull_request:
name: Webpack bundle diff
jobs:
  build-head:
    name: 'Build head'
